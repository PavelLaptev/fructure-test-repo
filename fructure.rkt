; idea: flip a switch to change which is implied, list or app

; top â—‡
; cursor â–¹
; hole âŠ™
; hole-ellipses âŠ™...
#; ((_... (â–¹ whatever) âŠ™...) â†’ (_... whatever (â–¹ (âŠ™ pat)) âŠ™...))
; BUT
#; ((_... (â–¹ (âŠ™ pat)) âŠ™... (â–¹ whatever)) â†’ (_... âŠ™... (â–¹ whatever)))
; actually, alternatively to above:
; select âŠ™... normally, but on transformation, clone it to the right
; another alternative: when âŠ™... selected, ENTER expands it hole + âŠ™...



#| notes for expr var entry

when an expr var /hole/ is selected, and enter is pressed,
the hole is first replaced by a blank symbol
then we enter text autocomplete mode

when a character is entered, we add that char to the current symbol
if the current symbol doesn't prefix-match against the in-scope list
the symbol should be rendered in red
otherwise, it should be rendered in green

should we allow entry of bad chars period? or just refuse to?

|#


#| notes on transertion searchlection duality

well maybe later

more prosaically for now:

hit enter while hole is selected
if only one thing can fit in that hole, it is inserted
(so need to have list of things that can fill holes of certain sorts)
otherwise, the LIST of things that can be entered is inserted
and we active searchlection mode, but CONFINED to that list
so we naviate the cursor up and down that list
when enter is pressed again, that option replaces the whole list

should we allow navigating into a particular option on the list,
and beginning a 'subtransertion' inside that element?
in other words, if we descended into an element, enter would
not pick the surrounding list element, but rather spawn a new
menu in the hole that was selected.

symbolically:
take transformation rules whose lhs is hole of appropriate type
create list of rhs templates
